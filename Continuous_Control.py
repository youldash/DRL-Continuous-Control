# 
# You are welcome to use this coding environment to train your agent for the project. Follow the instructions below to get started!
# 
# ### 1. Start the Environment
# 
# Run the next code cell to install a few packages.  This line will take a few minutes to run!

# In[1]:


get_ipython().system('pip -q install ./python')


# In[2]:


get_ipython().system('pip -q install torchviz')


# The environments corresponding to both versions of the environment are already saved in the Workspace and can be accessed at the file paths provided below.  
# 
# Please select one of the two options below for loading the environment.

# In[3]:


# Imports.
import time
import random
import torch
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# High-resolution plots for retina displays.
get_ipython().run_line_magic('config', "InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'")

# Utility imports.
from itertools import count
from collections import deque
from torch.autograd import Variable
# from torch import nn
from torchviz import make_dot, make_dot_from_trace

# Hide any deprecate warnings.
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

# Agents interact with, and learns from environments.
from agent import Agent
from model import Actor, Critic

get_ipython().run_line_magic('load_ext', 'autoreload')
get_ipython().run_line_magic('autoreload', '2')


# In[4]:


# Unity environment.
from unityagents import UnityEnvironment

# Select this option to load version 1 (with a single agent) of the environment.
# env = UnityEnvironment(file_name='/data/Reacher_One_Linux_NoVis/Reacher_One_Linux_NoVis.x86_64')

# Select this option to load version 2 (with 20 agents) of the environment.
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name='/data/Reacher_Linux_NoVis/Reacher.x86_64')


# Environments contain **_brains_** which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. Here we check for the first brain available, and set it as the default brain we will be controlling from Python.

# In[5]:


# Get the default brain.
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]


# #### Obtain NVidia GPU information

# In[6]:


# Set the working device on the NVIDIA Tesla K80 accelerator GPU (depending on availability).
# Otherwise we use the CPU.
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
print('Using device:', str(device).upper())
print()

# Log additional info (when using the NVIDIA Tesla K80 accelerator).
# See <https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/tesla-k80/>.
if device.type == 'cuda':
    print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
    print('Memory Usage:')
    print('Allocated:', round(torch.cuda.memory_allocated(0)/1024**3,1), 'GB')
    print('Cached:   ', round(torch.cuda.memory_cached(0)/1024**3,1), 'GB')


# ### 2. Examine the State and Action Spaces
# 
# Run the code cell below to print some information about the environment.

# In[7]:


# Reset the environment.
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# Number of agents.
num_agents = len(env_info.agents)
print('Number of agents:', num_agents)

# Size of each action.
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size
print('Size of each action:', action_size)

# Examine the state space.
states = env_info.vector_observations
state_size = states.shape[1]
print('There are {} agents. Each observes a state with length: {}'.format(states.shape[0], state_size))
print('The state for the first agent looks like:', states[0])


# ### 3. Take Random Actions in the Environment
# 
# In the next code cell, you will learn how to use the Python API to control the agent and receive feedback from the environment.
# 
# Note that **in this coding environment, you will not be able to watch the agents while they are training**, and you should set `train_mode=True` to restart the environment.

# In[8]:


env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]      # Reset the environment.
states = env_info.vector_observations                  # Get the current state (for each agent).
scores = np.zeros(num_agents)                          # Initialize the score (for each agent).
while True:
    actions = np.random.randn(num_agents, action_size) # Select an action (for each agent).
    actions = np.clip(actions, -1, 1)                  # All actions between -1 and 1.
    env_info = env.step(actions)[brain_name]           # Send all actions to tne environment.
    next_states = env_info.vector_observations         # Get next state (for each agent).
    rewards = env_info.rewards                         # Get reward (for each agent).
    dones = env_info.local_done                        # See if episode finished.
    scores += env_info.rewards                         # Update the score (for each agent).
    states = next_states                               # Roll over states to next time step.
    if np.any(dones):                                  # Exit loop if episode finished.
        break

print('Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: {}'.format(np.mean(scores)))


# ### 4. It's Your Turn!
# 
# Now it's your turn to train your own agent to solve the environment!  A few **important notes**:
# - When training the environment, set `train_mode=True`, so that the line for resetting the environment looks like the following:
# ```python
# env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]
# ```
# - To structure your work, you're welcome to work directly in this Jupyter notebook, or you might like to start over with a new file!  You can see the list of files in the workspace by clicking on **_Jupyter_** in the top left corner of the notebook.
# - In this coding environment, you will not be able to watch the agents while they are training.  However, **_after training the agents_**, you can download the saved model weights to watch the agents on your own machine!
